## Code for paper titled "Improving Replay Sample Selection and Storage for Less Forgetting in Continual Learning"

This repo contains 4 dirctories all based on the mammoth continual learning repo:
- `original_mammoth/` contains the unaltered mammoth code used for running the reservoir population strategy.
- `herding_mammoth/` contains the altered mammoth code where the memory buffer is populated via the herding population strategy.
- `gss_mammoth/` contains the altered mammoth code where the memory buffer is populated via the gss popualation strategy.
- `ipm_mammoth/` contains the altered mammoth code where the memory buffer is populated via the ipm population strategy.

Apologies for the rough looking repository. My goal is to clean this up as soon as I can for easier use.
